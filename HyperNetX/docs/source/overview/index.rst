The `HyperNetX`_ library was developed to support researchers modeling data
as hypergraphs. We have a growing community of users and contributors.
For questions and comments you may contact the developers directly at: hypernetx@pnnl.gov

`HyperNetX`_ was developed by the `Pacific Northwest National Laboratory <https://www.pnnl.gov/>`_ for the
Hypernets project as part of its High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) program.
PNNL is operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under Contract DE-ACO5-76RL01830.

* Principle Developer and Designer: Brenda Praggastis

* High Performance Computing: Tony Liu, Andrew Lumsdaine
* Principal Investigator: Cliff Joslyn
* Program Manager: Mark Raugas, Brian Kritzstein
* Mathematics, methods, and algorithms: Sinan Aksoy, Dustin Arendt, Cliff Joslyn, Andrew Lumsdaine, Tony Liu, Brenda Praggastis, and Emilie Purvine



New Features in Version 1.0
---------------------------

1. Hypergraph construction can be sped up by reading in all of the data at once. In particular the hypergraph constructor may read a Pandas dataframe object and create edges and nodes based on column headers. 
2. The C++ addon :ref:`nwhy` can be used in Linux environments to support optimized hypergraph methods such as s-centrality measures.
3. The JavaScript addon :ref:`widget` can be used to interactively inspect hypergraphs in a Jupyter Notebook.
4. We've added four new tutorials highlighting the s-centrality metrics, static Hypergraphs, :ref:`nwhy`, and :ref:`widget`.
